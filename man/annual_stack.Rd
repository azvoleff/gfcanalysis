\title{Generate an annual stack of forest change from GFC product}
\usage{
annual_stack(gfc, dataset = "GFC-2022-v1.10")
}
\arguments{
\item{gfc}{thresholded extract of GFC product for a given AOI (see 
\code{\link{threshold_gfc}})}

\item{dataset}{which version of the Hansen data to use}
}
\description{
Uses thresholded GFC data as output by \code{\link{threshold_gfc}} to make 
an annualized layer stack of forest change. See Details for the class codes 
used in the annual raster stack. The \code{\link{animate_annual}} function 
can be used to produce an animation of forest change from the generated 
layer stack.
}
\details{
The output raster stack uses the following codes to describe forest change 
at each pixel:
\tabular{lc}{
    Nodata               \tab 0 \cr
    Forest               \tab 1 \cr
    Non-forest           \tab 2 \cr
    Forest loss          \tab 3 \cr
    Forest gain          \tab 4 \cr
    Forest loss and gain \tab 5 \cr
    Water                \tab 6 \cr
}
